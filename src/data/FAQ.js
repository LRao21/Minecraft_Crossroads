    question: "How do we know what a crossroad is?",
    answer: `We first heard the term "crossroad" in reference to one of the voyages of <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wandering_Trader" target="_blank">the Wandering Trader</a> (right). Nice fellow! We don't seem him often, but the word came up enough to leave us other villagers curious. The closest crossroad we have is the pathways connecting our homes, after all.

            Our wandering friend described a crossroad as a place of meeting. That, however, implies meeting with someone. Was it us villagers, villagers at another location, or perhaps something else entirely? We must say first that our friend is <em>rather</em> talkative, so the silence that pursued each time these questions came was odd, to say the least.

            After asking him later on in the privacy of our library, we found our answer: "Steve."`,

    question: "What do we know about this \"Steve\" we mention?",
    answer: `Based on the Wandering Trader's tales, "Steve" appears to be one of his clients. From what we've gathered of them, they tend to be all over the place, meeting the trader across his voyages, but also sometimes at a dwelling of their own similar to ours.

            Beyond their locale, "Steve" continuously amazes us in their odd features. We've made a drawing of them based on the Trader's remarks (left). They seem of similar stature to us but with some stark differences. For example, their arms can move and hold items! It is perhaps not as exciting to others, but to us, it's remarkable. The only creatures we know capable of this are the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enderman" target="_blank">"endermen"</a>. Another point of interest is their <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Armor" target="_blank">attire</a>. Steve seems to be able to "upgrade" their attire. It's not secret to us, of course. Our wonderful <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Trading#Weaponsmith_2" target="_blank">smiths</a> are capable of making great armor that has been traded all over. Yet, there is something else to this being.

            If anything, Steve is so odd to us because they feel "away", in a sense. There is some sensation to them that feels old yet afar. Our endermen friends have picked up on that easily, and they have not taken their presence well, as so we've heard. The best indicator of this was the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Nether_portal" target="_blank">portal</a> (right), as we've drawn. <em>No one</em> has made those prior--at least not us. Our endermen friends reside in all three realms, and Steve has found a way into all of them. A strange fellow, indeed. We have yet the pleasure of meeting.`,

    question: "What exactly is our crossroad?",
    answer: `Across our many discussions with the Trader, we realized the extent to which we have learned about the places beyond us. We have never seen them, yet we know of its grass and its lights and its skies. We have a crossroad of our own now, fueled in part by Steve's conversations with the Trader. Steve, in that sense, is our crossroad!

            Thus, we are MineCraft Crossroads: a place made to expand on the comparisons of our world and Steve's through the lens of architecture (and other handfuls of components.) Join us as we deepen the crossroad that has brought us all together so dearly!`,

    question: "Who runs Minecraft Crossroads?",
    answer: `MineCraft Crossroads is run by a team of three members of our world (the "server" as Steve calls it.) Our members met at our founder's village through invitations from them, joining the team part-time and contributing to its development through their unique experiences with architecture in the different parts of the world while also keeping a lookout for Steve.`,
