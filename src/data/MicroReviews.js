        "Sometimes, I just want to learn from tutorials or templates created by other builders, especially when I reached a block or am looking for a specific style for a specific piece I want in my world--even if I don't have the time or energy to plan out complex buildings. If you ever feel the same way, or in general are looking for a place with a range of build tutorials categorized by build type, style, etc., take a look at Build it! Built it! hosts a lot of free and to-pay very (perhaps even overly) detailed pictoral tutorials/instructions for specific structures fitting a range of styles! You can tell the creators put in a lot of work. They are great for inspiration and practice!"

        "As much as creating my own stuff is great, sometimes I want to learn more about in-game features and implement some of that knowledge into my creations. For the village structures especially, it would be helpful to have a place to look at for structure details and blueprints to better understand the buildings and even recreate them. If you feel the same way, look no further than the Minecraft Wiki's Blueprints page! They go in depth for each item found in villages in each biome, showing layer-by-layer breakdowns of each structure! They also have a lot of useful content about the game across their other pages, so check those out too!"

        "Personally, I've always struggled with understanding brewing in Minecraft. Although it's likely been taught somewhere in the tutorials, I've always had issues combining ingredients properly to get what I want, often either because I don't understand the ingredients or don't know the name of a potion I want. If you feel similar, potioncraft.net might be worth a look! They break down each potion by ingredients (and with pictures!), making it easy to connect which ingredients give the effects you want. They also give some helpful links, making referencing information faster and easier than searching online randomly. Overall, I'll be saving this page for later."

        "I remember the first time I saw someone post their most recent project online. The first thing that captivated me was the huge roofs on their towers. It felt like an exagerated mediveal-themed day dream for someone learning about that style of build, making the moment all the more awe-filled. The best point of that sort of design is the asthetic. It's beautiful, grand, and well-fitting on just as intricate towers-especially when built into a larger world design. However, I can't find much use for it. When I went to make my own, I realized how small they can really be if your tower isn't incredibly large as its size partly depends on its base. Lighting was difficult too as the area for lighting decreases with each extension of the tower. Nonetheless, if planned right, it is possible to make them a useful elements of the tower. Personally, I will just seal mine off and hope for the best. You can't replace the view a pretty, tall roof on a mythical tower."

        "Birch Wood is a type of wood available in Minecraft's forests, birch forests, dark forests, and meadows. When made into planks, it gets a rather light color close to a white or a cream. Given its different color from other woods in the game, it can be difficult to include in builds that darker asthetic pallets, limiting its use to builds focusing on brighter pallets on some occasions. Personally, for a while I agreed with this as I too like those pallets. Nonetheless, I have some to see the block differently now, and would argue that difference actually gives it value because it acts then as a supplementary block instead of a main pallet color. I like to use it to highlight certain shapes in builds that more uniform pallets, like stairs in a house with an exceptionally dark theme. The contrast gives more color to the space, making the planks live up to its reputation as a less useful wood type but with a twist as it provides a sense of duality while being easy on the eyes."
